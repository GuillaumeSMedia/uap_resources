# The Evolution

In The Beginning, the Flying Saucer phenomenon became a
reality with reported sightings by credible witnesses in the summer of 1947. 
The reports by Kenneth Arnold on June 24th and United Airlines pilots on July 4th were the focus of media
attention and created a shroud around the events in and around
Roswell, New Mexico beginning on July 2nd. The sightings there
and reports of a crash nearby set the stage for the evolution of a cover-up .

## Stage One

The realization by military officials that the crash remains
were in fact debris from one of those mysterious flying disks was
evidence enough to issue an order of secrecy in the interests of
national security. Was it the product of a failure of some
experimental project of ours? Could it be German or Soviet or
Chinese? Whatever the source, we would not want anyone to know
that we had recovered the remains. Many questions would have to
be answered. What caused the crash? Were there identifiable
bodies subsequently recovered? Were they human? 

The investigation begins as top military officials caucus to
delineate the options. The White House must be notified. Top
military specialists are called in to identify components,
materiel construction, and determine a power and propulsion
source. Medical Officers are required to identify any biological
remains. Radiation and other detection equipment and experts
would be needed not only to test the debris, but to scan the
crash site. 

Exhausting all available internal military resources,
outside help would be needed. In the event that unidentifiable
humanoid remains were recovered, top medical and anthropological
scientists would be required for extensive forensic pathology.
Top research institutions and universities would be canvassed to
recruit the best medical specialists, the best chemical
specialists, and the most respected experts in the physics
disciplines. A specialized security team would be needed to
brief and debrief the research effort and report to central
management.

## Stage Two

Contact is made, and with it the removal of all doubt about
the non-human origin of the discoveries. Perhaps a preliminary
understanding is reached between the parties involved.
By 1952 it is obvious to the central crisis management team,
that social impact tests are necessary in order to update
existing historical models based on the impact of the hysterical
effects of the Orson Welles 1938 broadcast of H.G. Wells' "The
War of the Worlds". There could be no second guessing. Official
Public disclosure would be irreversible. At this time, no
economic impact of disclosure would likely be apparent.
Disclosure during the transition of the presidency would be
untenable.

By 1954 the stage was set for controlled testing of the
waters of public reaction. The most viable option chosen was the
selection of representatives of society brought in for controlled
experiments involving exposure to the extraterrestrial culture. 

These selected few individuals would be monitored to offer a
glimpse of the reactions to be expected among differing factions
within the society. Typical selections might include an esoteric
journalist, a major media journalist, a theologian, and a retired
public policy official with an expertise in cattle breeding.

Such a selection could offer such a pragmatic review by virtue of
the individual and collective reactions.

By 1958 more sophisticated studies are required to determine
a methodology for public disclosure, based on a thorough analysis
of historical solutions to dramatic confrontations. Studies
would be commissioned under the guise of an infant space program
to address the effects of the discovery, with a protocol to focus
on a modern solution to avoid social apocalypse. 

## Stage Three

The extraterrestrial visitors requiring some kind of
biological food source, determine cattle to be a viable
commodity. Perhaps a genetically specialized breed is required
to obtain the needed nutrients in a processable form.

Specialized genetic breeding experiments are conducted through
federal and private grant foundations and institutions. An
agreement is reached with the extraterrestrials to supply the
specialized food source in exchange for certain technological
assistance. Mutilations occur in the interim and continue to
proliferate despite the support program. An increased
extraterrestrial population could further tax the effort. 

## Stage Four

Economic impact studies reveal a significant effect on
fossil fuel industries upon disclosure of the existence of a
revolutionary energy efficient power source, a product of
extraterrestrial craft technologies. Other technological
disclosures would impact greatly on financial markets related to
precious metal and element compounds. Abrupt public disclosure
could have a cataclysmic effect on institutional scientific
education which could result in total obsolescence of basic
tenets.

## The Final Equation

Use subliminal media to acclimate the society to the
surrealistic phenomenon. Monitor the metered releases of
information to the general public, while maintaining an official
policy of denial.

Develop and incorporate the new technologies in a controlled
evolution cycle. Appropriate "black" budgetary financing and
encourage overt corporate and institutional discretionary
finacing for specified programs.

Maintain a program of disinformation for the purpose of
controlling the acceptance factor. Discredit unplanned leaks and
discoveries by special interest groups. Develop a covert plan
for rapid response to uncontrolled disclosure events perpetrated
by the extraterrestrials. Develop an emergency defense to
counter unexpected extraterrestrial agression.

Promote mutual global understanding and encourage programs
that lessen the fundamental differences between earth cultures. 

Develop a worldwide equal access communications network to
permit real-time audio visual contact. Encourage westernized
adaptations of freedom of thought to facilitate the acceptance of
a surrealistic phenomenon and lessen the subservient reaction
expected from less developed cultures. The China initiative
devised by Henry Kissinger and President Nixon, President
Carter's Camp David Accord, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glastnost Policy,
and The Nobel Prize going to the United Nations Peace Keeping
Forces evidence the success of such a doctrine.

The extraterrestrial agenda in the dissolution of the coverup involves a more visible profile by exposing the reality of
their physical existence. The exposure must be explicitly
calculated in order to allow plausible deniability, yet
conclusive enough to validate and document. Visual and physical
evidence in the Gulf Breeze, Florida sightings clearly point out
their intricate capabilities of accomplishing such a task

## Anatomy of a Cover-Up

How The Flow Chart Works

The Annapolis Research and Study Group has prepared a flow
chart to provide an easier understanding of how we feel the
cover-up works. The Roswell, New Mexico crash in 1947 represents
the first major public relations problem regarding the flying
disc phenomena. From that point it became necessary to do two
things regarding the cover-up, finance it and administer it. The
United States government and corporate America divides the responsibilities.

On the government side the infant space program, which later
became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration channels
data to and from "think tanks", which develop policy and provide
recommendations. The public relations oriented NASA aligns space
exploration advances with precisely what studies indicate are the
average national levels of understanding and interest.

On the corporate side, fraternal organizations provide the
setting for the power elite to interface. The corporations also
channel data to the "think tanks", whose policy studies determine
the focus of the various research institutes. These research and
development institutes and laboratories are equiped to derive and
develop any available alien technologies and data obtained from
crash retreival operations including biological remains. They
also could develop the technologies obtained from a possible
ongoing inter-acti on with extraterrestrial beings. The end
result is that these technologies benefit the general public in
many ways. 

On the Government side, both the Executive and Military
branches provide intelligence services. These various agencies
a recharged with the responsibility of gathering information.
After the information is obtained, it is either suppressed or
disinformation is disseminated by various methods. The result is
that the cover-up is perpetuated. FOIA requests are
substantially "blacked out" for reasons of national security and
the general public is denied virtually all access to any
definitive verifiable data.

Americans with their ravenous consumer appetites easily
succumb to the manipulations of the powerful corporate element.
Public opinion and the perception of concepts are the product of
repetitous exposure to mass media, easily manipulated by the
corporate controllers. Through a variety of mass media,
especially movies and television specials, we are slowly being
acclimated to the prospect of an extraterrestrial presence. The
news media, print and broadcast, 
have become another viable avenue for information and disinformation as the public debates
the existence of the issue. Currently the favored sensitization
technique is through the use of television commercials. It's all
part of a means to an end. The eventual result is a gradual
growing of public awareness of the physical reality of the
phenomenon. The best way of avoiding culture shock from massive
changes resulting from any societal phenomenon or scientific
breakthrough is to take it one step at a time.
